<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This dish is originally from Valencia, Spain and is one of the 
    best-known dishes in Spanish cuisine. Paella can be seafood only
    or it can be mixed with poultry(chicken or duck). <em>Paella de 
    marisco</em> replaces meat with seafood and omits beans and green 
    vegetables. <em>Paella mixta</em> combines meat, seafood, vegetables,
    and sometimes beans, with the traditional rice.

        <li>Heat the olive oil in a paella pan over medium-high heat; cook and stir the onion until lightly browned. Stir in the chicken, shrimp, lobster, and clams; cook and stir until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Pour in the seasoning liquid.</li>
        <li>Stir in the rice, pour in the hot chicken stock, and simmer until the rice is nearly tender, about 15 minutes. Add mushrooms, peas, and mussels; stir two times, and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat; cover and let stand until rice is soft and flaky, about 7 minutes.</li>
